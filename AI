Write a code draw a Mandelbrot set fractal using Python. 
The program should:

- Ask the user to input their first name and use that to generate a unique seed for a color palette.

- Ask the user for a zoom level (e.g., 1 to 100) and adjust the view of the Mandelbrot accordingly.

- Use NumPy for computation and Matplotlib for visualization.

- Return only code, organized in three sections: (1) User Input and Parameter Setup, (2) Mandelbrot Set Computation, (3) Plotting and Saving the Image.

- Add comments to the code explaining each major block of logic.

- Make sure the code is runnable, and generates a unique image based on the userâ€™s name and zoom.
